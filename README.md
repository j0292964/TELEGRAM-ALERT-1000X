# Telegram Crypto Alert Bot

This project tracks Ethereum whale wallets and alerts when multiple smart whales buy
and hold a new token. It communicates exclusively through Telegram.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Automatically scans Ethereum mainnet using a QuickNode endpoint
- Identifies wallets that bought new coins early, held 20+ days and achieved
  1000x profits
- Clusters wallets that buy and hold together
- Sends real-time alerts to a Telegram channel when two or more smart whales
  accumulate a new coin
- All alerts and progress logs are posted to Telegram
- Designed only for Ethereum mainnet (no CEX or social features yet)
- Code is modular and easy to expand later to more chains or features
